# R-Control One Roadmap

## Overview
R-Control One is a comprehensive media control and device integration platform built as an R1/RabbitOS plugin using the r1-create SDK. This provides full hardware access, AI integration, and mobile optimization for the R1 device. The system includes a hosted backend for secure multi-tenant data management, allowing multiple users to access personalized services while maintaining complete data isolation. This roadmap outlines the development phases for building a secure, feature-rich plugin using a JavaScript monorepo with React UI components and Node.js backend.

## Core Principles
- **R1-Create Integration**: Leverage full hardware access (accelerometer, PTT button, scroll wheel) and AI capabilities
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support multiple users on a hosted backend with complete data isolation
- **Security First**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data separation
- **Modular Design**: Build reusable components for different media integrations optimized for 240x282px display
- **User Isolation**: Each user's data and connections remain completely separate
