# R-Control One Roadmap

## Overview
R-Control One is a dedicated music playback device and media controller built as an R1/RabbitOS plugin using the r1-create SDK. The core focus is seamless music playback with Osu-inspired UI featuring scrollable blades, song previews, and dynamic backgrounds that match album colors. Songs can be shared between devices using Boop Share's high-frequency audio transfer. Sensitive user data is stored securely on the device itself, with a separate control panel for management. The system includes minimal backend support for authentication and large file transfers when needed.

## Core Principles
- **R1-Create Integration**: Leverage full hardware access (accelerometer, PTT button, scroll wheel) and AI capabilities
- **Secure Device Storage**: Store sensitive data locally on R1 device with PIN-based access control
- **Device-as-Database**: Use R1 device storage as primary data store, no traditional database needed
- **Security First**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data separation
- **Modular Design**: Build reusable components for different media integrations optimized for 240x282px display
- **User Isolation**: Each user's data and connections remain completely separate
